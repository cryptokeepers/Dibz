Dibz
====

A Crypto-currency project


Dibz looks to offer a peer-to-peer marketplace using its own blockchain.  It will be using its own unique distribution model aimed at targeting consumers who are not already involved in crypto.  We want to base our project on connecting the latest technology to people worldwide in an understandable format.  Many people are intrigued by crypto, and many more are intimidated by it.   Our goal is to spread information and acceptance through easy to understand videos and tutorials.  We also want to acclimate consumers with the concept of having "satoshi's" of a coin and not just the full coins.  There are many barriers and Dibz will be focusing on breaking them down to help crypto with mass adoption!
